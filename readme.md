With this project you can use "Chatbot-UI" as user interface for your Rivet projects!
This allows you to create complex LLM based processes (e.g. a teachable assistant) in a visual programming interface and interact with it via a beautiful chat UI. Chatbot-UI also keeps all the conversation history, so we do not need to care about that!

Features:
- Creates an OpenAI SDK compatible API for any rivet project
- Captures streaming output from a configured node
- Streams the output
- Transforms messages, before sending them to the rivet graph
- Beautiful Chat-UI (provided by Chatbot-UI)
- Chatbot-UI features: Multiple chats with conversation history, Integrated RAG etc.

*Note: Written instructions can be found on the lower part of the template page*

# 2. Local setup
## Rivet-Chat-API
For simplicity all is explained for Visual Studio Code. You can of course run it in other IDEs.

### Software installation (prerequisites)
1. Install **Visual Studio Code**: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
1. Install **node.js + node package manager**: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (in the install process, make sure you also install npm package manager!)
1. Install **Github**: https://desktop.github.com/

### Clone the repo
1. Open terminal or command line
1. Enter ```git clone https://github.com/ai-made-approachable/rivet-chat-api.git```

### Configure the project
1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code (File -> Open Folder)
1. Open "Terminal -> New Terminal" and enter ```npm install```
1. Go to /.vscode/ folder
1. Rename "launch_sample.json" to "launch.json"
1. Open "launch.json" and replace the value for OPEN_API_KEY with your OpenAI Key

### Running the project
Just press "Run -> Start Debugging" in Visual Studio Code.
Continue with the "Chat setup". The URLs displayed are the endpoints to connect the chat to rivet-chat-api.

### Use your own project files
- Make sure your project file has an input of type "chat-message" and array checked (Type: chat-message[])
- Rename the "Chat" node you want to have streaming output to "output"
- Select a main graph in "Project" settings
- Add your file into the /rivet folder and remember the filename

### Using plugins
If you want to use plugins, you need to import and register them first in graphManager.ts

Example for mongoDB Plugin
```
import rivetMongoDbPlugin from 'rivet-plugin-mongodb';
import * as Rivet from '@ironclad/rivet-node';
Rivet.globalRivetNodeRegistry.registerPlugin(rivetMongoDbPlugin(Rivet));
```

---
## Graph Config
- in `/config` you need to set the proper input name and output node name
- input must accept an array of ChatMessage `chat-message[]`
see video: https://youtu.be/dM8hiOMnMzU?t=564

## Open Chat Playground (simplest hosted method)
You can find many open source chat clients.
For example: [Open Chat Playground](https://github.com/abetlen/open-chat-playground)
You can just use their statically hosted Github Page: 
https://abetlen.github.io/open-chat-playground/
- set BaseURL to your localhost endpoint, CORS should be enabled
- set Model to `example.rivet-project` or which ever rivet project in your rivet directory you want to run 

There are many other open source chat UI you can use.

### Chatbot-UI
"Chatbot-UI" as it is a very user friendly UI (similiar to ChatGPTs UI): https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui

### Software installation (prerequisites)
1. Install **Docker**: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Install Chatbot-UI
Note: This installation is a bit long, but it is a one time thing!

1. Open terminal (MacOs) or command line (Windows)
1. ```git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui.git```
1. Navigate into the folder of the repository ```cd chatbot-ui```
1. Install dependencies ```npm install```
1. Install superbase: ```npm install supabase```
1. Make sure Docker is running
1. Start Supabase ```supabase start```
1. Create file .env.local ```cp .env.local.example .env.local```
1. Open ".env.local" in Visual Studio Code (in chatbot-ui root folder)
1. Get the required values by running ```supabase status```
1. Copy "API URL" value and insert it into "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL"
1. Copy "anon key" and insert it into "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
1. Open ```supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql``` file
1. Replace "service_role_key" with the value from ```supabase status``` and save

Note: Also see instructions on: https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui

### Starting the Chat-UI
1. Make sure Docker is running
1. Navigate to your "chatbot-ui" folder
1. Enter ```npm run chat```
1. Navigate to the URL shown to you, usually: http://localhost:3000

### Configure the Chat-UI
1. When you start "chatbot-ui" for the first time enter e-mail + password (don't worry, all stays locally on your pc)
1. In the sidebar press on "Models" (Stars-Icon) and on "New Model"
1. Enter any name
1. Add the name of your graph e.g. "example.rivet-project" as model
1. Enter ```http://localhost:3100/``` as Base URL
1. Enter anything as API key
1. Open the model selection in the top-right corner and select your custom model
1. Have fun chatting

# 3 Additional features

## 3.1 Accessing environment variables
All environment variables are automatically available via the context node.

## 3.2 Using plugins
When you boot up the application, it will tell which plugins are supported and what environment variables need to set to make them work.
As this might change often, this is easier than trying to keep this readme up-to-date.

Example:

```
Available Plugins and Required Environment Variables:
-----------------------------------------------------
Plugin: chroma
  Activate with env var: USE_CHROMADB_PLUGIN (set to 'true' to enable)
  Required env var for databaseUri: CHROMA_DATABASE_URI
-----------------------------------------------------
```

Note: I did not test every plugin if it works. Please contact me if there are issues.

## 3.3 Additional debugging
You can send data to an "raise event" node with id "debugger" to log the data to the console. This is useful if you run the graphs in the cloud.

## 3.4 Streaming output to the API
Generally you can potentially use any node as output, but currently only nodes that either stream the output (chat nodes) or provide a clear output value (e.g. text node, object node) are supported. All nodes that shall be made available need to be renamed to "output"

Non-Streaming output will still be streamed (but very quickly) by the rivet-chat-api for a better user experience.

## 3.5 CORS issues
If you are using the API from another domain you might run into CORS errors. To fix this you can add `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN` to the environment variables (e.g. "*")
